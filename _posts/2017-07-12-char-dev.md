title: "Linux Kernel Character Device"
---

Some notes on writing a char device for the linux kernel. I am writing for kernel 4.1.33 and these things seem to change from time to time so keep that in mind. 

This is generally a pretty good guide: http://www.tldp.org/LDP/lkmpg/2.6/html/lkmpg.html but not perfect and leaves some things for you to figure out yourself, some of those for me are covered below.

# Overview
When writing a kernel device driver file objects are really your best bet to communicate between user space and kernel space. Implementing custom syscalls is more trouble than it is worth so it is best to map whatever communication you want into a set of file objects and present them in /dev/* for user programs to interact with. One driver can have 255 "files" so there is a lot of space to play with there but it still requires a little mental-remapping.

One driver, many files is represented using major and minor numbers attached to the driver and the files. This is visible using ls on /dev, you will see a column that is two numbers separated by a comma, that is the major and minor number. The Major number is assigned to your driver by the kernel (you can request one but really you should just use its assignment), the minor number is entirely up to your driver, nothing else cares about it. 

Your driver will only register one set of functions to handle all file operations and must dispatch based on minor number inside those functions based on a kernel "file" struct, some functions recieve an "inode" struct as well but the file is a common argument to all and contains an inode pointer.

You can find the minor number by calling MINOR(*inode->rdev) found in <linux/kdev_t.h>. 

Userspace programs may "cat /proc/devices" to find your driver's major number.

# initcall()
That document, and many references online assume you will be creating a dynamically loadable module. I however am not, because android. So some things are different.

One is you need to become familiar with *_initcall() calls instead of module_init(). There are several *_initcall()s you can use to register your module, they are documented here: https://lwn.net/Articles/141730/ . device_initcall() seems appropriate here. Supposedly module_init() will transform into an *_initcall() for a statically loaded module but that didn't seem to work for me.

Or my module wasn't loaded because I didn't provide MODULE_LICENSE(), MODULE_AUTHOR(), MODULE_DESCRIPTION() calls that I think are required now but not covered in the base guide linked above. So do those too, as always it is a good idea to get a "hello world" actually loaded and see it print on your system before digging deeper.

# User memory
The kernel memory space and the user memory space are separate so any memory must be explicitly copied between the two, you cannot for example dereference the char* buffer passed into the read() and write() calls. You must access them through special operators. 

For "control register" style devices that only expect a char or two of data you can use the get_user() and put_user() calls to get and put simple types from user memory.

For data style devices that expect a lot of data you should use copy_from_user() and copy_to_user().

For all of this memory it is probably good to check access_ok() on the user buffer before you try to use it. Probably best to not crash the kernel due to a user-space error.

# Accessing hardware registers, aka IO memory
More memory spaces, yeah!! 

So if you are reading a specsheet and it tells you what memory locations to modify in order to modify the system's registers you cannot directly access that memory from the linux kernel. You must first map it into your memory space via ioremap().

Similar to user-space memory there are also a bunch of special functions used to access this memory, you should not do direct pointer access (I think it is possible in this case just discouraged). These look like ioread{8,16,32}() and iowrite{8,16,32}().

# Links
Many of the Google results for searches in this space end up with the same high level information rehashed over and over. So here are some actually useful links:

* https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/lk/lk-11.html
  * deeper dive into how the registration system and inode resolution happens when you open a device file.
* http://www.makelinux.net/ldd3/chp-3-sect-2
  * discusses major and minor numbers in the kernel and the macros to get them.
* http://www.xml.com/ldd/chapter/book/
  * Orielly book on device drivers, seems legitly shared? By author I assume.
