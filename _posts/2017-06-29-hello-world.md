Hello World!

Jekyll on github is finally a low-maintence, open, extensible, logical, and
nerdy enough system to finally get me writing blogs and making use of my domain
I have been "squatting" on for decade or so.

Hopefully I will start documenting my projects on here and keeping notes on
deep-dives into subjects.
